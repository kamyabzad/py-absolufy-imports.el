** Dependencies
Install absolufy-imports python package.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ pip install absolufy-imports

** Notes
In order to work, py-absolufy-imports.el need to know the root directory of your code. For this purpose, it looks for an indicator file in the parent directories of the buffer's visiting file. You can customize the list of indicator files using the variable =py-absolufy-imports-root-indicators=. Imports will be converted relative to the first found indicator.

Put an indicator file, such as =.python-root.el= in the root directory of your code.

** Usage

=M-x py-absolufy-imports-buffer=
